                    <span>Dear Hiring Manager,</span>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am excited to apply for the <mark>Technical Support Analyst</mark> role at your organization. 
                    With a background in <em>Information Technology</em> and certifications including 
                    CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and AWS Cloud Practitioner, I bring a strong foundation 
                    in troubleshooting, customer service, and technical problem-solving. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my previous roles at <strong>Marshalls</strong> and as a <strong>Substitute Teacher</strong>, 
                    I gained valuable experience managing responsibilities in <em>fast-paced, high-pressure environments</em>. 
                    These roles sharpened my ability to multitask, communicate clearly, and remain professional when 
                    assisting customers or students. I am eager to bring these same qualities to supporting clients and 
                    colleagues at your company.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am especially motivated by your mission of combining healthcare and technology to drive 
                    meaningful outcomes. I believe this aligns perfectly with my own long-term career goals in IT 
                    support and systems administration. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills 
                    and enthusiasm can contribute to your team.  
                </p>

                <p>Sincerely,<br>
                <span>Favio Gonzalez</span></p>
