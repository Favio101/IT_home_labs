# üß™ IT Home Lab Projects

Welcome to my personal IT home lab repository. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology and hold the CompTIA A+ certification. Since I don't yet have direct IT work experience, I'm using this lab to build real-world skills in systems administration, networking, virtualization, and troubleshooting.

This repository documents my learning journey through hands-on projects that simulate environments and tasks found in entry-level IT roles such as help desk, desktop support, and junior sysadmin.

## ‚úÖ Project 1: Building Active Directory Domain in Windows Server 2025 VM

**Goal:** Practice virtualization basics, navigating an Active Directory, and OS installation using VMware.

### üîß Steps:
- Downloaded and installed VMware
- Downloaded official Windows Server 2025 ISO from Microsoft
- Created a VM with:
  - 4 GB RAM
  - 60 GB virtual hard drive
  - Default NAT networking
- Installed Windows Server 2025 successfully and completed first-time setup
- Created an Active Directory Domain and set up a server as the domain controller
- Create OUs, Users, and Groups
- Added Users to Groups

### üß† What I Learned:
- How to mount ISO files and boot from them
- Basic VMware configuration (RAM, disk size, boot order)
- The purpose of virtualization for lab and enterprise environments
- Navigating an Active Directory
- Managing OUs, Users, and Groups

## ‚úÖ Project 2: SQL Basic Library Project

**Goal:** Strengthen my understanding of relational databases and practice writing queries to extract meaningful insights from real-world business data. I completed this project as part of my Database Programming transfer course for WGU.

### üîß Tasks:
- Queried client borrowing behavior from a library database using SQL
- Used `JOIN's and nested queries to combine data from multiple tables (e.g., clients, books, authors)
- Filtered data using `WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`, and `YEAR()` functions
- Aggregated data using `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, and `GROUP BY` clauses
- Applied `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` to control output and find top or least frequent values
- Created a `VIEW` to store reusable results

### üß† What I Learned:
- How relational databases organize data across linked tables
- Efficient ways to analyze trends using SQL (e.g., most borrowed genres, top borrowing occupations)
- The role of `JOIN`s in combining data for analysis
- How to think through and translate business-style questions into SQL logic


## ü™™ About Me

I'm currently an IT undergraduate and recently earned my CompTIA A+ certification. My goal is to break into an entry-level IT support or analyst role by building a strong foundation in technical support, networking, and systems administration. This home lab is part of my self-directed journey to learn practical skills and demonstrate initiative.
